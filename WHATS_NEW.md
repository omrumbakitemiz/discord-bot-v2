## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Railway"
git push -u origin main

# 2. Go to Railway
# Visit https://railway.app
# Click "New Project" > "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# Select your repository

# 3. Add Environment Variables
# In Railway dashboard, add:
# - DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
# - DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
# - COMMAND_PREFIX=!

# 4. Done! Railway auto-deploys
```

## 📋 Railway Configuration Explained

### Why Each File Matters

#### `nixpacks.toml` - **MOST IMPORTANT**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs", "ffmpeg"]  # ← This installs FFmpeg!
```
**Without this**: Audio streaming won't work
**With this**: FFmpeg is automatically installed

#### `railway.json`
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10  # ← Auto-restart on crash
  }
}
```
**Benefit**: Bot automatically recovers from crashes

#### `Procfile`
```
worker: npm start  # ← Defines as worker, not web server
```
**Benefit**: Railway treats it as a background process
